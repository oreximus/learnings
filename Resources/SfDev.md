Building Softwares we have multiple Developers

1. Main branch --> all work is getting merge here!

2. Tracing the Work of individual Developer and then merge them Accordingly.

3. Have to review code by everyone in a daily routine.

- Problem in above workflow is getting merge the bug in the code. And increase the code breaking problem.

    - To takle take **unit test** and **integration test** into consideration.

    - Pushing code to main then, and getting it ready for the production env.
        - Github Actions, Build, Deploy Stuffs

    - If you get the Bug in Product, then you'll repeat the Process of Development by working on individual component and Test them and merge the code later in the main branch.
    - Time of Deployment should be Low.
    - Take a Look at tag-release for more adding code to main as a efficient development context.

    - Creating a `pre-product` kind of things for the Product Owner or Developers to take the Next for Consideration.
