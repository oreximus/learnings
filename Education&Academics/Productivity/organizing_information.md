### I learned a productivity system for organizing life

- Folder Structure that can be as followed:
	- PARA (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives)
		- Projects:
			"You store things that you are actively working on!"
		- Areas:
			"Areas of responsibilites in your life" (like paying bills or it could be your needs in life)
		- Resources:
		    "Book notes and inspiration"
        - Archive:
            "You move the things which are no longer needed but might need in the future!"

- You can organize your cloud to organize your personal data.
    - You create a common note folder where you can put whatever you want then you can categorize them later.

***The structure of notes should match the structure of your life, because the purpose of the notes is to support and enhance your life.***

***Don't organize like any research database which is aesthetically pleasing, instead of it make it very simple and easy to understand.***

***Start with the simple stuffs until they breaks, only then you can move something a little more powerful!.***
