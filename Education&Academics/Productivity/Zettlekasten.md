    - Writing notes in your words rather than using direct quotes.
    - Write notes as if you are writing to someone so you include the enough context.
    - Include the source of information so you can always find it.

- Luhmann also developed could of different types notes to log information:
    
    - **Fleetings Notes**: these are the random thought and epiphannies that pops into your own head, thoughts in a day.
    - **Literature Notes**: these are notes when reviewing and consuming content, whether it's an article, book, presentation, podcast, or any other resource.
