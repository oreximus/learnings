# Science Terminologies

## Terms From Thermodynamics:

- **Adiabatic**: relating to or denoting a process or condition in which heat does not enter or leave the system concerned.\[1\]
- **Isothermal**: involving or processing a constant temperature.\[2\]
- **Entropy**: 
    - the measure of a system's thermal energy per unit temperature that is unavailable for doing useful work.\[3\]
        - From ScienceNotes.org \[3\]
        - Entropy is a measure of the randomness or disorder of a system.
        - Its symbol is the capital letter S. Typical units are joules per kelvin (J/K).
        - Change in entropy can have a positive (more disordered) or negative (less disordered) value.
        - In the natural world, entropy tends to increase. According to the second law of thermodynamics, the entropy of a system only decreases if the entropy of another system increases.
