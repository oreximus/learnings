# Thermodynamics

## Notes

- The branch of physics science that deals with the relations between heat and other forms of energy (such as mechanical, electrical, or chemical energy), and, by extension, of the relationships between all forms of energy.\[1\]

- What is heat?
    - In thermodynamics, heat is the thermal energy transferred between systems due to a temperature difference. In colloquil use, heat sometimes refers to thermal energy itself. \[2\]

### Basics from Britannica.com \[3\]

- **thermodynamics**, science of the relationship between heat, work, temperature, and energy. In broad terms, thermodynamics deals with the transfer of energy from one place to another and from on form to another.

- The key concept is that heat is a form of energy corresponding to a definite amount of mechanical work.

**Some Historical Stuffs**:

- Heat was not formally recognized as a form energy until about 1798, when Count Rumform (Sir Benjamin Thompson), a British military engineer, noticed that limitless amounts of heat could be generated in the boring of cannon barrels and that the amount of heat generated is proportional to the work done in turning a blunt boring tool.

- Rumford's observation of the proportionality between heat generated and work done lies at the foundation of thermodynamics.

- Another pioneer was the French military engineer **Sadi Carnot**, who introduced the concept of the heat-engine cycle and the principle of **reversibility** in 1824. Carnot's work concerned the limitations on the maximum amount of work that can be obtained from a **steam engine** operating with a high-temperature **heat transfer** as its driving force.

    - **Carnot Engine**:\[4\]
        - The carnot engine is a theoretical thermodynamic cycle proposed by Leonard Carnot. It estimates the maximum possible efficiency that a heat engine during the conversion process of heat into work and, conversely, working between two reservoirs can possess.

        - **Carnot Theorem**: Any system working between T<sub>1</sub> (hot reservoir) and T<sub>2</sub> (cold reservoir) can never have more efficiency that the Carnot engine operating between the same reservoirs.

        - Also, the efficiency of this type of engine is independent of the nature of the working substance and is only dependent on the temperature of the hot and cold reservoirs.

        - **Carnot Cycle**: A carnot cycle is defined as an ideal reversible closed thermodynamic cycle, Four successive operations are involved: isothermal expansion, adiabatic expansion, isothermal compression, and adiabatic compression. During these operations, the expansion and compression of the substance can be done up to the desired point and back to the initial state.
