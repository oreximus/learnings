## Typecasting in C

### Typecasting:

Typecasting in C is the process of converting one data type to another data type by the programmer using the casting operator program design.

In typecasting, the destination data type may be smaller than the source data type when converting the data type to another data type, that's why it is also called narrowing conversion.

**Syntax**:

```
int x;
float y;
y = (float) x;
```

#### Types of Type Casting in C

In C there are two major types to perform type casting:

1. Implicit Type Casting
2. Explicit Type Casting

##### Implicit Type Casting

- Implicit type casting in C is used to convert the data type of any variable without using the actual value that the variable holds.

- It performs the conversions without altering any of the values which are stored in the data variable. Conversion of lower data type to higher data type will occur automatically.

### Switch Statement in C

- Switch case statement evaluates a given expression and based on the evaluated value (matching a certain condition), it executes the statements associated with it. Basically, it is used to perform different actions based on different conditions(cases).

    - Switch case statements follows a selection-control mechanism and allow a value to change control of execution.
    - They are a substitute for long **if statements** that compare a variable to several integral values.
    - The switch statement is a multiway branch statement. It provides an easy way to dispatch execution to different parts of code based on the value of the expression.

In C, the switch case statement is used for executing one condition from multiple conditions. It is similar to an if-else-if ladder.

- The switch statement consists of conditional-based cases and a a default case.
