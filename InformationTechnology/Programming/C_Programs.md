## For Reversem Number, Total Digits and Sum of All Numbers.


Example Number:

123214

- Reverse Number

We need the last Digit and Left rest of the number

123214/10

And store it in a variable **a**

Now Again we need to add this number to some variable:

from example we get 4 in the **a** value so,

**r** is some variable and we'll store the reverse number value into it:

r = (r\*10)+a

- Total Digits

We'll make a variable **c** and initialize it with zero,

As the loop is going the value of c will increment, through increment operator;

c++

- Sum of all Digits

we have variable **a** where the digits get stored,

now we can create a variable **s** to store the sum value in it:

s = s + a
