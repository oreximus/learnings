# Notes

## Introduction:

- Firstly,
  _Architecture is about the important stuff... whatever that is._ - Ralph Johnson

- Second, the role of the software architect embodies a massive
  amount and scope of responsibility that continues to expand. A
  decade ago, software architect dealt only with the purely
  technical aspect of architecture, like modularity, components,
  and patterns.

- Since then, because of the new architectural styles that
  leverage a wider swath of capabilities (like microservices), that
  role of software architect has expanded.

- Third, software architecture is a constantly moving target
  because of the rapidly evolving software development ecosystem.
  Any definition cast today will be hopelessly outdated in a few
  years.

- Fourth, much of the material about software architecture has
  only historical relevance. Readers of the Wikipedia page won't fail
  to notice the bewildering array of acronyms and cross-references
  to an entire universe of knowledge. Yet, many of these acronyms
  represent outdated or failed attempts.

- Even solutions that were perfectly valid a few years ago cannot
  work now because the context has changed. The history of software
  architecture is littered with things architects have tried, only
  to realize the damaging side effects.

- The scope of software architecture isn't the only part of the
  developmet world that constantly changes.

- New technologies, techniques, capabilities...in fact, it's
  easier to find things that haven't changed over the last decade
  than to list all the changes.

- Software architects must make decisions within this constantly
  changing ecosystem. Because everything changes, including
  foundations upon which we make decisions, architects should
  reexamine some core axioms that informed earlier writing about
  software architecture.

- For example, earlier books about software architecture don't
  consider the impact of DevOps because it didn't exist when these
  books were written.

- When studying architecture, readers must keep in mind that, like
  much art, it can only be understood in context. Many of the decisions
