# Notes

## Introduction:

- Firstly,
  _Architecture is about the important stuff... whatever that is._ - Ralph Johnson

- Second, the role of the software architect embodies a massive
  amount and scope of responsibility that continues to expand. A
  decade ago, software architect dealt only with the purely
  technical aspect of architecture, like modularity, components,
  and patterns.

- Since then, because of the new architectural styles that
  leverage a wider swath of capabilities (like microservices), that
  role of software architect has expanded.

- Third, software architecture is a constantly moving target
  because of the rapidly evolving software development ecosystem.
  Any definition cast today will be hopelessly outdated in a few
  years.

- Fourth, much of the material about software architecture has
  only historical relevance. Readers of the Wikipedia page won't fail
  to notice the bewildering array of acronyms and cross-references
  to an entire universe of knowledge. Yet, many of these acronyms
  represent outdated or failed attempts.

- Even solutions that were perfectly valid a few years ago cannot
  work now because the context has changed. The history of software
  architecture is littered with things architects have tried, only
  to realize the damaging side effects.

- The scope of software architecture isn't the only part of the
  developmet world that constantly changes.

- New technologies, techniques, capabilities...in fact, it's
  easier to find things that haven't changed over the last decade
  than to list all the changes.

- Software architects must make decisions within this constantly
  changing ecosystem. Because everything changes, including
  foundations upon which we make decisions, architects should
  reexamine some core axioms that informed earlier writing about
  software architecture.

- For example, earlier books about software architecture don't
  consider the impact of DevOps because it didn't exist when these
  books were written.

- When studying architecture, readers must keep in mind that, like
  much art, it can only be understood in context. Many of the
  decisions architects made were based on realities of the environment
  they found themselves in.

- For example, on the of the major goals of late 20th-century
  architeture included making the most expensive, one of the mojor
  shared resources, because all the infrastructure at the time was
  expensive and commercial: operating systems, application servers,
  database servers, and so on.

- Imagine stroling into a 2002 data center and telling the head of
  operation "Hey I have a greate idea for a revolutionary style of
  architecture, where each service runs on its own isolated machinery
  with its own dedicated database (describing what we now know as
  microservices)."

- So, that means I'll eed 50 licenses for Windows, another 30
  application server licenses, and at least 50 database server licenses."

- In 2002, trying to build an architecture like microservices would
  be inconceivably expensive. Yet, with the advent of open source
  during the intervening years, coupled with updated engineering
  practices via the DevOps revolution.
