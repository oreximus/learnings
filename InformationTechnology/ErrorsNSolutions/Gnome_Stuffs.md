# Gnome Common Issues:

## On Gnome 44, there is an issue to applying any custom themes completely:

### Solution:

- First Download any Gnome Theme that you want!

- Then Apply theme by usual methods: Configuring from **gnome-tweaks** and also **enabling User Theme feature** from **Gnome Extensions**.

- Then **Gnome 44** is using **libadwaita** theme, so you need this [**script**](https://github.com/odziom91/libadwaita-theme-changer) to change it too.
