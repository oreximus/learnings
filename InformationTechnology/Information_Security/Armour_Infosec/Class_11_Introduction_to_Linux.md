# Class 11: Introduction to Linux

## Overview

This class provides a high-level introduction to the Linux operating system, including its history, the concept of the shell, and its core features.

## What is Linux?

* Linux is a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel.
* The kernel was first developed and released by **Linus Torvalds in 1991**.

## The Shell

* In technical terms, the shell is a user interface for accessing the services of the operating system's kernel.
* It's a command-line interpreter that takes commands from the user and executes them.
* It acts as the outer layer between the user and the kernel, which is the core component that operates the hardware.
* Common shells include `bash` (Bourne Again Shell), `zsh`, and `fish`.
* The terminal prompt indicates which user is logged in and their privilege level:
    * `$` indicates a normal, non-root user.
    * `#` indicates the `root` user (superuser) with full administrative privileges.

## Key Features of Linux

* **Open Source**: The source code is freely available for anyone to view, modify, and distribute, under licenses like the GPL (General Public License).
* **Multitasking**: The system can run multiple processes and applications simultaneously.
* **Multiuser**: Multiple users can access system resources like memory, CPU, and storage at the same time.
* **Portability**: Linux can run on a wide variety of hardware platforms, from servers and desktops to embedded systems and mobile phones.
* **Security**: Its open-source nature allows vulnerabilities to be found and patched quickly by a global community. The permission model (user, group, other) also adds a strong layer of security.
* **Stability and Reliability**: Linux is known for its stability, capable of running for long periods without needing a reboot.
* **Community Support**: A massive global community provides extensive documentation, forums, and support.
* **Performance**: Known for efficient use of system hardware, leading to high performance.
* **Unix Compatibility**: Linux is highly compatible with the Unix operating system, following standards like POSIX.
