# Class 02: IP Address

## Overview
This class covers the fundamentals of IP addresses, their versions, and their structure.

## IP Address Definition
- **IP Address**: A unique identifier assigned to devices in a network for communication.

## Versions of IP

### IPv4
- **Size**: 32-bit address
- **Structure**: Divided into four octets (8 bits each), separated by dots (e.g., 192.168.1.1)
- **Range**: 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255
- **Total Possible Addresses**: 4,294,967,296 (2³²)
- **Description**: Widely used but limited by address exhaustion, leading to IPv6 adoption.

### IPv6
- **Size**: 128-bit address
- **Structure**: Divided into eight groups of 16 bits, represented in hexadecimal and separated by colons (e.g., 2001:0db8::1)
- **Total可能的Addresses**: 2¹²⁸ (approximately 340 undecillion)
- **Description**: Designed to replace IPv4, offering a vastly larger address space and improved features.
