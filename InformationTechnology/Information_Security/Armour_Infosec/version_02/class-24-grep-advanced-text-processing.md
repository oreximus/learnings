# Class 24: Advanced Text Processing with grep and Pattern Matching

## Theory Section - grep Command Fundamentals

### What is grep?

- **grep**: Global Regular Expression Print
- **Purpose**: Search for patterns in text files or command output
- **Usage**: Essential tool for system administration and log analysis
- **Power**: Supports regular expressions for complex pattern matching

### Basic grep Syntax

```bash
grep [options] pattern [file(s)]
```

## Practical Section - grep Command Examples

### Removing Empty Lines and Comments

#### Removing Empty Lines

```bash
# Remove all empty lines from a file
grep -v '^$' file-name
```

- **^**: Beginning of line anchor
- **$**: End of line anchor
- **^$**: Matches lines that start and end immediately (empty lines)
- **-v**: Invert match (show lines that DON'T match)

#### Removing Comments

```bash
# Remove lines starting with # (comments)
grep -v '^#' file-name
```

- **^#**: Lines that start with # character
- **-v**: Show lines that don't start with #

#### Removing Both Empty Lines and Comments

```bash
# Method 1: Using pipe
grep -v '^#' file-name | grep -v '^$'

# Method 2: Using extended regex (more efficient)
grep -Ev "(^#|^$)" file-name
```

- **-E**: Extended regular expressions
- **|**: OR operator in regex
- **(^#|^$)**: Match lines starting with # OR empty lines

### Pattern Matching Examples

#### Filtering Content Starting with Specific Text

```bash
# Filter lines starting with 'log'
grep '^log' file-name
```

#### Character Class Matching

```bash
# Filter lines containing 'a' or 'n'
grep "[an]" file-name
```

- **[an]**: Character class matching either 'a' or 'n'

#### Using Pattern Files

```bash
# Match patterns from one file against another file
grep -f file-with-the-pattern file-to-match-the-pattern
```

- **-f**: Read patterns from file
- **file-with-the-pattern**: File containing search patterns (one per line)
- **file-to-match-the-pattern**: File to search in

### POSIX Character Classes

#### Alphabetic Characters

```bash
# Filter lines containing alphabetic characters
grep "[[:alpha:]]" filename
```

#### Alphanumeric Characters

```bash
# Filter lines containing letters and numbers
grep "[[:alnum:]]" filename
```

#### Uppercase Letters

```bash
# Filter lines containing uppercase letters
grep "[[:upper:]]" filename
```

#### Lowercase Letters

```bash
# Filter lines containing lowercase letters
grep "[[:lower:]]" filename
```

#### Numeric Characters

```bash
# Filter lines containing numbers
grep "[[:digit:]]" filename
```

### Command Output Filtering

#### Network Interface Filtering

```bash
# Filter 'inet' from ifconfig command output
ifconfig | grep 'inet '
```

- **Note**: Space after 'inet' to avoid matching 'inet6'

#### Process Filtering

##### Filtering Root Processes

```bash
# Show processes running as root
ps aux | grep '^root'
```

##### Filtering Non-Root Processes

```bash
# Show processes NOT running as root
ps aux | grep -v '^root'
```

### Advanced grep Options

#### Recursive Directory Search

```bash
# Search for pattern recursively in directory
grep -inr "/path/" /directory/ 2>/dev/null
```

- **-i**: Case-insensitive search
- **-n**: Show line numbers
- **-r**: Recursive search through directories
- **2>/dev/null**: Suppress error messages

#### File Name Only Output

```bash
# Show only filenames containing the pattern
grep -ilR "/path/" /directory/ 2>/dev/null
```

- **-l**: Show only filenames (not content)
- **-R**: Recursive search (same as -r)

### Pattern Matching with Repetition

#### Exact Number Matching

```bash
# Match exactly four digits
grep '[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]' /etc/passwd

# Show only the matched portion
grep '[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]' /etc/passwd -o
```

- **-o**: Show only the matched part of the line

#### Advanced Pattern Examples

```bash
# Match lines containing single character after 'name'
grep "name." filename

# Match lines containing double character after 'name'
grep "name.." filename

# Match lines containing triple character after 'name'
grep "name..." filename
```

- **.**: Matches any single character

#### Number Pattern Matching

```bash
# Match 'name' followed by exactly three digits
grep "name[0-9][0-9][0-9]" filename

# Match numbers starting with 9 followed by two digits
grep "9[0-9][0-9]" filename
```

### Character Range Matching

#### Alphabetic Ranges

```bash
# Match lowercase letters
grep '[a-z]' filename

# Case-insensitive alphabetic matching
grep -i '[a-z]' filename
```

#### Numeric Ranges

```bash
# Match four-digit numbers (regular users in /etc/passwd)
grep "[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]" /etc/passwd

# Show only the matched four-digit numbers
grep "[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]" /etc/passwd -o
```

## Advanced grep Techniques

### Regular Expression Anchors

```bash
# Beginning of line
grep '^pattern' file

# End of line
grep 'pattern$' file

# Whole word matching
grep '\bword\b' file

# Case-insensitive search
grep -i 'pattern' file
```

### Combining grep with Other Commands

#### Log Analysis Examples

```bash
# Find error messages in system logs
grep -i error /var/log/syslog | tail -20

# Count occurrences of a pattern
grep -c 'pattern' filename

# Show context around matches
grep -A 3 -B 3 'pattern' filename  # 3 lines after and before
```

#### System Administration Examples

```bash
# Find listening ports
netstat -tuln | grep LISTEN

# Find specific processes
ps aux | grep -v grep | grep apache

# Search configuration files
grep -r "ServerName" /etc/apache2/

# Find files modified today
find /var/log -name "*.log" -mtime 0 | xargs grep -l "error"
```

### Practical Exercises

#### Exercise 1: Log File Cleaning

```bash
# Create a sample configuration file with comments and empty lines
cat > sample.conf << EOF
# This is a configuration file
ServerName example.com

# Database settings
DatabaseHost localhost
DatabasePort 3306

# Cache settings

CacheEnabled true
# End of file
EOF

# Clean the file (remove comments and empty lines)
grep -Ev "(^#|^$)" sample.conf
```

#### Exercise 2: User Analysis

```bash
# Find all regular users (UID >= 1000)
grep "[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]" /etc/passwd

# Extract usernames of regular users
grep "[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]" /etc/passwd | cut -d: -f1

# Find users with bash shell
grep "/bin/bash$" /etc/passwd
```

#### Exercise 3: Network Analysis

```bash
# Find all IP addresses in log files
grep -oE '[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}' /var/log/auth.log

# Find failed SSH login attempts
grep "Failed password" /var/log/auth.log | awk '{print $11}' | sort | uniq -c

# Find successful SSH logins
grep "Accepted password" /var/log/auth.log | awk '{print $11}' | sort | uniq -c
```

### Windows User and Group Management

#### User Account Management

- **Public Directory**: Contains files accessible by any user
- **Shared Folders**: Visible under Computer Management â†’ Shared Folders
- **Remote Access**: Access shared folders via IP address in Run dialog

#### Accessing Shared Resources

```cmd
# In Run dialog (Windows + R)
\\192.168.2.21
```

#### Remote Desktop Connection

```cmd
# In Run dialog
mstsc
```

- **mstsc**: Microsoft Terminal Services Client
- **Purpose**: Remote desktop connection to other Windows machines

### Backup Operator Group

- **Purpose**: Special Windows group with backup and restore privileges
- **Permissions**: Can backup and restore files regardless of file permissions
- **Usage**: Assigned to users who need to perform system backups
- **Security**: Members can bypass normal file security for backup purposes
