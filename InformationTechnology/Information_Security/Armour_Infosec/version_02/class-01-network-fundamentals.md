# Class 1: Network Fundamentals

## Theory Section

### What is a Network?

- **Network**: Net + Work
- A system of interconnected devices that can communicate and share resources

### Types of Networks

#### 1. LAN (Local Area Network)

- **Device**: Switch
- **Range**: 4m - 100m
- **Devices Supported**: 2 to 100 PCs
- **Use Case**: Small offices, homes, single buildings

#### 2. CAN (Campus Area Network)

- **Device**: L3 Switch (works on Layer 3 - Network Layer)
- **Range**: 4m - 1km
- **Devices Supported**: 2 to 100 PCs
- **Use Case**: University campuses, large corporate complexes

#### 3. MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)

- **Device**: Router (organization-owned)
- **Range**: 4m - city wide
- **Devices Supported**: 2 or more locations
- **Use Case**: City-wide networks, ISP networks

#### 4. WAN (Wide Area Network)

- **Device**: Router (by ISPs)
- **Range**: 4m - worldwide
- **Devices Supported**: 2 or more locations
- **Use Case**: Internet, global corporate networks

#### 5. PAN (Personal Area Network)

- **Device**: Personal devices for data sharing
- **Range**: Up to 10m
- **Devices Supported**: 1 to few devices
- **Use Case**: Bluetooth connections, personal device networks

#### 6. WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network)

- **Device**: Wi-Fi Router
- **Range**: 20m - 50m
- **Devices Supported**: 2 or more devices
- **Use Case**: Home Wi-Fi, office wireless networks

#### 7. WCAN (Wireless Campus Area Network)

- **Device**: Wi-Fi Access Point (AP)
- **Range**: 20m - 1km
- **Devices Supported**: 2 to 250 PCs
- **Use Case**: Campus-wide wireless coverage

#### 8. WMAN (Wireless Metropolitan Area Network)

- **Device**: Wi-Fi CPE (Customer Premises Equipment)
- **Range**: 20m - 15km
- **Devices Supported**: 2 or more points
- **Use Case**: City-wide wireless networks

#### 9. WWAN (Wireless Wide Area Network)

- **Device**: Cellular infrastructure
- **Range**: 15km - 1000s of km
- **Devices Supported**: Cellular devices, IoT devices
- **Use Case**: Mobile networks, satellite communications

## Practical Section

### Network Infrastructure Concepts

- **Lease Line**: Dedicated connection between two points
- **ISP Hierarchy**: T1 (IANA to Country) → T2 (Country to ISP) → T3 (ISP to City)

### Key Takeaways

1. Network types are classified by range and infrastructure
2. Each network type uses specific devices optimized for its range
3. Wireless networks parallel wired networks but with different coverage patterns
4. Understanding network types helps in designing appropriate network solutions

## Study Questions
