# Class 01: Networks

## Overview
This class introduces the concept of networks and the various types based on their geographical scope, devices, and supported ranges.

## Network Definition
- **Network**: A system of interconnected devices (Net + Work) that communicate to share resources and data.

## Types of Networks

### LAN (Local Area Network)
- **Device**: Switch
- **Range**: 4m–100m
- **Devices Supported**: 2 to 100 PCs
- **Description**: Connects devices within a small area, like an office or home, using switches for local communication.

### CAN (Campus Area Network)
- **Device**: Layer 3 Switch (operates at Network Layer)
- **Range**: 4m–1km
- **Devices Supported**: 2 to 100 PCs
- **Description**: Connects multiple LANs within a campus or large facility, using Layer 3 switches for routing.

### MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)
- **Device**: Router (organization-owned)
- **Range**: City-wide (up to 50km)
- **Devices Supported**: Connects 2 or more locations
- **Description**: Spans a city, connecting multiple LANs or CANs, typically managed by organizations or ISPs.

### WAN (Wide Area Network)
- **Device**: Router (managed by ISPs)
- **Range**: 4m–worldwide
- **Devices Supported**: Connects 2 or more locations
- **Description**: Covers large geographical areas, often global, managed by ISPs for internet connectivity.

### PAN (Personal Area Network)
- **Device**: Personal devices (e.g., smartphones, laptops)
- **Range**: Up to 10m
- **Devices Supported**: 1 to a few devices
- **Description**: Used for personal device connectivity, such as Bluetooth or USB sharing.

### WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network)
- **Device**: Wi-Fi Router
- **Range**: 20m–50m
- **Devices Supported**: 2 or more devices
- **Description**: A wireless version of LAN, using Wi-Fi routers for connectivity within a limited range.

### WCAN (Wireless Campus Area Network)
- **Device**: Wi-Fi Access Point (AP)
- **Range**: 20m–1km
- **Devices Supported**: 2 to 250 PCs
- **Description**: Extends WLAN across a campus, using access points for broader coverage.

### WMAN (Wireless Metropolitan Area Network)
- **Device**: Wi-Fi CPE (Customer Premises Equipment)
- **Range**: 20m–15km
- **Devices Supported**: 2 or more points
- **Description**: Provides wireless connectivity across a city, often using specialized equipment.

### WWAN (Wireless Wide Area Network)
- **Device**: Cellular infrastructure (e.g., base stations)
- **Range**: 15km–thousands of kilometers
- **Devices Supported**: Cellular devices, IoT devices
- **Description**: Uses cellular networks for wide-area wireless connectivity, supporting mobile and IoT devices.

## Additional Notes
- **Leased Line**: A dedicated, point-to-point connection provided by ISPs for high-speed, reliable communication between two locations.
