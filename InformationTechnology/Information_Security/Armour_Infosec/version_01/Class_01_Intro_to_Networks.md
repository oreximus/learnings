# Class 01: Introduction to Networks

## Overview

This class introduces the fundamental concepts of computer networks, defining what a network is and exploring the various types based on their geographical scope.

## Network Types

A network is a collection of interconnected devices that can exchange data and share resources. Networks are categorized based on their size, geographical area, and the technology they use.

### 1. LAN (Local Area Network)

* **Device**: Primarily uses a Switch.
* **Range**: Covers a small area, typically from 4 to 100 meters.
* **Scale**: Supports a small number of devices, from 2 to 100 PCs.
* **Use Case**: Common in homes, offices, and single buildings.

### 2. CAN (Campus Area Network)

* **Device**: Often uses a Layer 3 Switch, which operates at the Network Layer of the OSI model.
* **Range**: Spans a larger area than a LAN, from 4 meters up to 1 kilometer.
* **Scale**: Connects multiple buildings within a university or corporate campus, supporting 2 to 100 PC.

### 3. MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)

* **Device**: Utilizes routers, often owned by the organization itself.
* **Range**: Covers an entire city or a large metropolitan area.
* **Scale**: Connects two or more locations across a city.

### 4. WAN (Wide Area Network)

* **Device**: Relies on routers provided by Internet Service Providers (ISPs), who are integral to the network.
* **Range**: Extends over a very large geographical area, from 4m-worldwide.
* **Scale**: Connects two or more locations globally. The Internet is the largest WAN.

### 5. PAN (Personal Area Network)

* **Device**: Uses your own personal devices (e.g., smartphone, laptop) for sharing data.
* **Range**: Very short, typically up to 10 meters.
* **Scale**: Connects one to a few personal devices. Bluetooth is a common example.

### 6. WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network)

* **Device**: Uses a Wi-Fi Router.
* **Range**: Typically 20 to 50 meters.
* **Scale**: Connects two or more points wirelessly within a local area.

### 7. WCAN (Wireless Campus Area Network)

* **Device**: Uses Wi-Fi Access Points (APs).
* **Range**: 20 meters to 1 kilometer.
* **Scale**: Supports from 2 to 250 PCs wirelessly across a campus.

### 8. WMAN (Wireless Metropolitan Area Network)

* **Device**: Uses Wi-Fi CPE (Customer Premises Equipment).
* **Range**: 20 meters to 15 kilometers.
* **Scale**: Connects two or more points across a city wirelessly.

### 9. WWAN (Wireless Wide Area Network)

* **Range**: Long-distance, from 15 km to thousands of Km (approximate).
* **Scale**: Connects cellular devices, IoT devices, and more over a vast area.
