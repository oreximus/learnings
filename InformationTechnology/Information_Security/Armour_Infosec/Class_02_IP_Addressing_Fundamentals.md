# Class 02: IP Addressing Fundamentals

## Overview

This class introduces the concept of an IP (Internet Protocol) address as a unique identifier for devices on a network. It covers the two primary versions of IP addresses: IPv4 and IPv6.

## What is an IP Address?

An IP address is a unique numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. It serves two main functions: host or network interface identification and location addressing.

### Versions of IP

There are two main versions of the Internet Protocol in use:

1.  **IPv4** (Internet Protocol version 4)
2.  **IPv6** (Internet Protocol version 6)

### IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4)

* **Size**: It is a 32-bit address.
* **Structure**: Divided into four sections called octets, each containing 8 bits.
* **Range**: Each octet can range from 0 to 255.
* **Total Possible Addresses**: Approximately 4.3 billion (4,294,967,296) unique addresses.

### IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6)

* **Size**: It is a 128-bit address, providing a vastly larger address space than IPv4.
* **Structure**: Divided into eight 16-bit sections, represented in hexadecimal notation.
