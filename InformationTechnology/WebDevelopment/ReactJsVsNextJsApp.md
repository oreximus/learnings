# Difference and Relation between React.js and Next.js Applications:

**source**: claude ai

React App:

Client-side rendering by default
Created using Create React App (CRA)
Requires manual setup for routing
JavaScript framework for building user interfaces
No built-in server-side rendering
Minimal initial configuration
Primarily for single-page applications (SPAs)

Next.js App:

Built on top of React
Provides server-side rendering (SSR) out of the box
Built-in routing system
Supports static site generation (SSG)
Includes performance optimizations
Easier configuration for complex applications
Supports both client-side and server-side rendering
Provides API routes
Better SEO capabilities

Key Differences:

Next.js is a React framework, not a separate technology
Next.js adds multiple rendering strategies
Next.js simplifies complex React app configurations
Next.js provides more built-in features for web applications
