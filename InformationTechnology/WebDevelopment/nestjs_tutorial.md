### Why NestJS so popular?

- It's opinionated, well-structured architecture, TypeScript support, scalability, and
  a strong community.

- Under the hood, Nest makes use of robust HTTP Server frameworks like **Express** (the
  default) and optionally can be configured to use **Fastify** as well.

- Nest (NestJS) is a framework for building efficient, scalable **Node.js** server-side
  applications. It uses progressive JavaScript, is built with and fully supports
  **TypeScript** (yet still enables developers to code in pure JavaScript) and combines
  elements of OOP (Object Oriented Programming), FP (Functional Programming), and FRP
  (Functional Reactive Programming).

### Getting Started with NestJS Project:

- installing nestjs cli utility globally:

```
npm i -g @nestjs/cli
