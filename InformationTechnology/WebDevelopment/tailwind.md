- there are two screens mainly we have
  1. **Desktop Screens**: taking space more likely in the horizontal manner.
  2. **Mobile Screens**: taking space more likely in the vertical manner.

## In the Mobile Screen:

- The Contents like **Cards**, **Blocks**, etc. are built in the individual rows.

- The max content in a row, in a more comfortable manner is **2**.

> The thing that we need to focus on here is, to maintain the content in a row
> or max 2 columns in a row.

## In the Desktop Screens:

- There are variation in the bigger screen:
  1. Equal Section: for example, you're dividing stuffs in the equal parts
     of the screen, taking the equal section in the screen.
  2. Non-Equal Section: for example, you're dividing stuffs in the screens
     by making them take unequal portions of the screen.
