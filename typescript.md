### What is Typscript? Why do we need it? And how is it different from Vanilla JS?

- A programming language to address **shortcomings** of **JavaScript**.

  > `JavaScript` is like a kid without the discipline, who does whatever he/she wants, on the
  > other hand `Typescipt` is like a kid with discipline.

- `Typscript` is built on the top of JavaScript, so every valid JS file is a valid Typescript
  file, but typscript has some of robust features, which allow to create maintained applications
  in less time. - Some of the important features javascript offers: 1. Static typing 2. code completion 3. refactoring 4. shorthand notations

### Static Typing:

| **Statically-typed**                                    | **Dynamically-type**                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| (c++, c#, java)                                         | (python, ruby, javascript)                              |
| int number = 10; // we cannot set it to `number = "a";` | let number = 10; // but we can set it to `number = "a"` |
